# Backdoor Detection Methods

This is a project used for detecting backdoor in different levels.

For model level, we choose [Neural Cleanse](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/backdoor-sp19.pdf).
For dataset level, [Spectral Signatures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00636.pdf) and [SPECTRE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11315.pdf) is chosen.
And for input level, we use [STRIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06531.pdf).
