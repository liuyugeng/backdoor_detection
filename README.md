# Backdoor Detection Methods

This is a pytorch project used for detecting backdoors at three different levels.

For the model level, we select [ABS](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/taog/docs/CCS19.pdf) and [Neural Cleanse](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/backdoor-sp19.pdf). 
For the dataset level, [SCAn](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-tang-di.pdf), [Spectral Signatures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00636.pdf), and [SPECTRE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11315.pdf) are chosen. 
And for the input level, we use [STRIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06531.pdf) and [Denoising AE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05195.pdf).
